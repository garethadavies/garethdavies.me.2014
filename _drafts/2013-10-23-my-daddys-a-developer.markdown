My daddy's a developer

Do you remember the days when you had all the time in the world to create you personal website? You could send hours just messing around with CSS animation or waste a whole day watching hours of Douglas Crockford videos on YouTube?

Then, one day you wake up and you are in your thirties, married with a young child and you have a mortgage to pay every month. You have grown up. Now you are lucky if you can read half a .net magazine every month because you fall asleep on the sofa at 9pm every night!

In this fastest of fast-paced industries, unless you keep up with the latest developments... 

How the hell do you keep up with all this?

Use your time wisely

If you drive to work, listen to podcasts during the journey.

If you commute by public transport (bad luck), take time to do research, prepare for the days work or send those all important emails.

Read a blog post every night in bed before you fall asleep.

Use pocket app to save articles for later consumption.

Follow the right people on Twitter

Exchange weekend lie-ins with your better half. Then you can either catch up on sleep or do some work in bed.

Focus your work

Focus your research towards the work you are doing now or soon will be. Spending hours looking a CSS grid systems when you are in a user testing period is wasting your time and is forgettable.

Use your experience

The main advantage you have over younger developers is your experience. You have been involved in the ups and downs of projects and you know

Remember what is important

Never, ever, ever forgo quality time with your family to do work unless absolutely necessary. They are the most important thing in your life and your spare time is your most precious time.
