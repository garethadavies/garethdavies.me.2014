  Responsive application...
paragraph1:
  A friendly and usable experience for the target audience was set as the overall goal for the Just Checking Carer+ web application. Careful planning and user experience testing have allowed the team to produce a single-page application that queries the Just Checking API for JSON data, which is then consumed by a front-end built using Backbone.js, MarionetteJS and Sass stylesheet language.
paragraph2:
  My role during this project was as primary user experience designer and front-end developer.
