		<div class="post">
		<p>I recently listened to an <a href="http://www.thefreelanceweb.com/podcast/ep21-work-life-balance/">episode</a> of the <a href="http://www.thefreelanceweb.com">freelance web podcast</a> concerning the difficulties of maintaining a good work/life balance for people in our industry.</p>

<p>After many years of slogging away at the cyber-coalface, I feel I have only now found a balance to my life that allows me to keep up with a rapidly changing industry, spend quality time with my family and get some time for myself.</p>

<p>So, I have decided to share what changes I have made to my life that have helped me to achieve a work/life equilibrium.</p>

<h3>I work smart, not hard</h3>

<p>Over the years, I have found several ways of improving my workflow and increasing my productivity. These include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Planning my projects fully before starting them</li>
<li>Using CSS frameworks and JavaScript plugins (Do not re-invent the wheel)</li>
<li>Automating tasks via grunt</li>
<li>Adding full comments to my code to help maintainance</li>
<li>Sketching ideas then building (Only doing wireframes and mockups when absolutely required)</li>
<li>Adhering to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY principal</a></li>
<li>Over-estimating (If it is going to take you 1 day, say 2)</li>
</ol>

<h3>I leave work at work</h3>

<p>Unless it is completely necessary, I do not code at home. I used to, but having to swap a desk for a cot meant that I now have to work on my macbook on my lap, on a sofa... So I don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Any work at home now usually consists of me researching and preparing for the work I plan to do the next day.</p>

<h3>I freelance only when I have to</h3>

<p>I have dabbled several times with doing freelance work on top of my day job and it has always been stressful.</p>

<p>If I ever do get persuaded into doing a website in a freelance capacity, I do tend to charge more money for it and insist on a realistic deadline. The reason for this is that I am using my own precious (limited) spare time to get this work done, and that is worth more and will take longer.</p>

<h3>I undertake sensible side projects</h3>

<p>I have always enjoyed doing side projects away from my 9-5 job. In the past, I would have worked on them for hours every night until 3 a.m., but no longer. I now follow these 3 rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>Only undertake small projects (1-2 week timescales maximum)</li>
<li>The project must include a new technology or technique that I have a desire to learn</li>
<li>I will not work after 10pm</li>
</ol>

<h3>I plan my week/days</h3>

<p>I know from week to week, what I am doing and when. I know that I have to take my daughter to the carers every morning, so I plan nothing for then. I go to the gym on tuesdays, thursdays and sundays, so I plan nothing for then. The time I get home from work until my daughters bedtime cannot be used for any work. So this leaves me with non-gym evenings to do my research etc.</p>

<p>This may seem inflexible, but by doing this, I know exactly when I have time to do work and how much I can realistically get done.</p>

<h3>I get regular exercise</h3>

<p>I sit at my desks for hours each day and this is not natural. I started going to the gym about 18 months ago and feel stronger and more alert for it. It also gives me time alone to ponder on any issues at work.</p>

<p>If your idea of hell is joining a gym, simply going for a jog, a cycle or even a walk will help.</p>

<h3>I eat properly</h3>

<p>I have integrated more healthy food into my daily routine. I arrive at work with 3 pieces of fruit that I eat at regular breaks during the day, thus meaning I get 3 of my 5-a-day at work and I get away from the desk as well.</p>

<p>In terms of drink, I bought a large water bottle that I keep on my desk. I no longer have fizzy drinks and only 1 coffee a day.</p>

<h3>I get the right amount of sleep</h3>

<p>I make sure I get at least 6, but preferably 8 hours sleep a night. I have realised that working until 3 a.m. is only going to burn me out and affect me negatively the whole of the next day, so my rule is to be in bed before 11pm.</p>

<h3>I never neglect my family</h3>

<p>I decided that I would never choose work over an opportunity to spend quality time with my family. I have stuck to this religiously and it has never affected my work.</p>
