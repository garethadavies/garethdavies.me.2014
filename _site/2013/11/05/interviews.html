		<p>I have been both an interviewer and interviewee on several occasions in both formal and informal situations.</p>

<p>In both roles, I have developed a number of rules and tips that I adhere to in the hope that I either find the right person for the job or I am the right person for the job.</p>

<p>Hopefully, you will find this post informative and helpful no matter if you are going for a new job or looking to hire someone.</p>

<h3>Tips for interviewees</h3>

<p>For the majority of the interviews I have ever attended, I generally know by the end of the interview whether the company/position is right for me. This is based on various things that I ask myself and them during the interview:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have I been greeted in a friendly manner on my arrival?</li>
<li>Have I met the team and been shown around their office?</li>
<li>Who is interviewing me? I ask a lot of questions.</li>
<li>Who will be your line-manager? Are they interviewing you?</li>
<li>Do they freely answer your questions about wages/hours/holiday etc?</li>
<li>Are they asking me to do any tasks outside of any normal process I would follow?</li>
<li>What does the future hold for this company?</li>
</ul>

<p>It is vital that the company and position is right for you. It is often easy to accept a job before you really consider it and the changes that may come along with it.</p>

<h3>Tips for interviewers</h3>

<p>There are a lot of cliches attached to traditional interview techniques that I find are completely useless in trying to find out what a person is really like.</p>

<p>You can pretty much guarantee that all of the inteviwees have the right skills to fill the role, so it is more important to make sure that this person will be a good fit for your company.</p>

<p>I find that the following tips help with this tricky situation.</p>

<h4>1. Focus the job description</h4>

<p>Asking for someone who is an expert in PHP/ASP.NET/RoR/Node/WordPress/Drupal/JavaScript/HTML/CSS/SASS/LESS/SQL/MySQL/Postgresql/UX etc etc etc, will put people off and doesn&#39;t exist anyway.</p>

<p>Focusing the required skills to 3 or 4 that the person absolutely must have will help you right from the outset.</p>

<h4>2. State the wages</h4>

<p>Not showing the expected wage level always makes me think that the company is already going to hire the person based on who will cost the least.</p>

<p>So, make it completely clear what the wages are for this position. This gives the person reading the description a good idea of the level of experience required and if it is worth applying at all, saving time and effort for both parties.</p>

<h4>3. Don&#39;t be cocky</h4>

<p>We have all been in interviews and know what a nerve-racking time they are. So don&#39;t be cocky or try to push your authority on someone you don&#39;t even know or the interview just won&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Remember that you are trying to find out who they are, not informing them how important (maybe) you are.</p>

<h4>4. Rate your skills... no!</h4>

<p>A company asking me to rate my skills on a sliding scale, will almost immediately be a company I have no interest in working for.</p>

<p>If you want to know the ability of a person to code or design, look at their previous work and ask questions about it during the interview. This will give you a much clearer picture of their competency. This can then be take further in a second task-based interview.</p>

<h4>5. Personality tests</h4>

<p>You are not going to learn about a person&#39;s personality via a questionnaire. You are more likely to find out about a person via a friendly chat and asking the right questions.</p>

<p>Bin them!</p>

<h4>6. Interview location</h4>

<p>Do the interview in a friendly environment not a massive boardroom with a giant mohogany desk between you and the person. You are putting up barriers when you really want to be bringing them down.</p>

<h4>8. Questions</h4>

<p>A massive list of questions, reeled off one by one is not ideal. Ask the inteviewee to show you a recent project they have done and get them to talk through the whole process they went through to make it a success. </p>

<h4>7. Interview tests</h4>

<p>I was once asked in an interview to &#39;quickly&#39; redesign a microwave control panel. Now, what I should have said (but didn&#39;t!) was &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do it like this&quot;, and I wouldn&#39;t. I never go blundering into a redesign of anything without consultation and research.</p>

<p>Suprise tests thrusted upon an interviewee may be a good indicator of the capacity of the person to handle pressure situations, but you cannot judge them on the outcome of that test as they are based on nothing and are not a realistic situation.</p>

<h4>5. Give feedback</h4>

<p>Always offer to give feedback on a person after you have interviewed them. This gives the person valuable information and also lets you stay in contact incase a more suitable role for them becomes available in the future.</p>

<p>If you just send an letter saying your application has faile, you kinda come across like a corporate robot following procedure.</p>
