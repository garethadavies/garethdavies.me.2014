I recently listened to an [episode](http://www.thefreelanceweb.com/podcast/ep21-work-life-balance/) of the [freelance web podcast](http://www.thefreelanceweb.com) concerning the difficulties of maintaining a good work/life balance for people in our industry.

After many years of slogging away at the cyber-coalface, I feel I have only now found a balance to my life that allows me to keep up with a rapidly changing industry, spend quality time with my family and get some time for myself.

So, I have decided to share what changes I have made to my life that have helped me to achieve a work/life equilibrium.

### I work smart, not hard

Over the years, I have found several ways of improving my workflow and increasing my productivity. These include:

1. Planning my projects fully before starting them
2. Using CSS frameworks and JavaScript plugins (Do not re-invent the wheel)
3. Automating tasks via grunt
4. Adding full comments to my code to help maintainance
5. Sketching ideas then building (Only doing wireframes and mockups when absolutely required)
6. Adhering to the [DRY principal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
7. Over-estimating (If it is going to take you 1 day, say 2)

### I leave work at work

Unless it is completely necessary, I do not code at home. I used to, but having to swap a desk for a cot meant that I now have to work on my macbook on my lap, on a sofa... So I don't.

Any work at home now usually consists of me researching and preparing for the work I plan to do the next day.

### I freelance only when I have to

I have dabbled several times with doing freelance work on top of my day job and it has always been stressful.

If I ever do get persuaded into doing a website in a freelance capacity, I do tend to charge more money for it and insist on a realistic deadline. The reason for this is that I am using my own precious (limited) spare time to get this work done, and that is worth more and will take longer.

### I undertake sensible side projects

I have always enjoyed doing side projects away from my 9-5 job. In the past, I would have worked on them for hours every night until 3 a.m., but no longer. I now follow these 3 rules:

1. Only undertake small projects (1-2 week timescales maximum)
2. The project must include a new technology or technique that I have a desire to learn
3. I will not work after 10pm

### I plan my week/days

I know from week to week, what I am doing and when. I know that I have to take my daughter to the carers every morning, so I plan nothing for then. I go to the gym on tuesdays, thursdays and sundays, so I plan nothing for then. The time I get home from work until my daughters bedtime cannot be used for any work. So this leaves me with non-gym evenings to do my research etc.

This may seem inflexible, but by doing this, I know exactly when I have time to do work and how much I can realistically get done.

### I get regular exercise

I sit at my desks for hours each day and this is not natural. I started going to the gym about 18 months ago and feel stronger and more alert for it. It also gives me time alone to ponder on any issues at work.

If your idea of hell is joining a gym, simply going for a jog, a cycle or even a walk will help.

### I eat properly

I have integrated more healthy food into my daily routine. I arrive at work with 3 pieces of fruit that I eat at regular breaks during the day, thus meaning I get 3 of my 5-a-day at work and I get away from the desk as well.

In terms of drink, I bought a large water bottle that I keep on my desk. I no longer have fizzy drinks and only 1 coffee a day.

### I get the right amount of sleep

I make sure I get at least 6, but preferably 8 hours sleep a night. I have realised that working until 3 a.m. is only going to burn me out and affect me negatively the whole of the next day, so my rule is to be in bed before 11pm.

### I never neglect my family

I decided that I would never choose work over an opportunity to spend quality time with my family. I have stuck to this religiously and it has never affected my work.
