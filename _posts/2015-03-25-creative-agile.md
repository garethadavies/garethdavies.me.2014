In my experience, UX and visual designers often find themselves feeling quite detached from the Agile process. Their work is often seen as separate from the development team as it is usually is done before sprint planning occurs and is often not presented or any feedback given before development work is supposed to begin.

I have found that this situation can often bring about the following problems:

- A long and disjointed planning session
- More questions raised than answers given
- Wayward or impossible estimations due to unknowns
- Confusion between the creative and development teams
- UX and visual designs needing updating creating a delay
- Time, effort and money wasted due to inaccuracies
- Extra development time required to adhere to UX or design that has already been signed off by stakeholders

Now, I don’t see this as a failure by anyone on the team and no one person is to blame. The reality is that these problems occur when creative and development work is silo’d by the company or organisation involved.

#### Solution

I am currently working on the Jaguar agile development team and we have come up with a solution for this common problem... The creative sprint.

But firstly, there are things that have been deemed essential to avoid in a creative sprint:

- Work done outside of the agile team
- Mid-sprint changes to high-level user stories
- Design or development work being done without agreed upon UX
- Stakeholders can only define high-level requirements. The solution is up to the team via the Product Owner

Then, ensure the following:

- The creative and development team work in the same location (They should be able to throw paper at each other)
- If working in the same location is not possible. Open a constant stream of communication via something like Slack and Google Hangouts
- Product owner involvement throughout the sprint for quick discussions and decisions
- Any decisions that take more than 2 hours for feedback can be decided by the team by proxy
- Constant feedback by all members of the team to all other team members. It's essential to talk... a lot

#### The Process

The first task is to get the whole team involved in the initial UX design. This will be helpful in avoiding possible inaccuracies. The UX expert in the team can utilise all the information from the team to form ‘back of cigarette packet’ guidelines for the team to take away and start doing their individual work. This includes:

- Creation of a prototype
- Creation of visual designs
- Proper documentation of UX
- Planning the back-end integration
- QA planning based on acceptance criteria

Then, with a prototype created you can start the following:

- QA testing prototype functionality according to the UX
- Applying the visual design to the prototype
- Integrating back-end
- UX/Design/Front-end refactoring

At all times, constant feedback between disciplines (Morning and afternoon catchups, are a good idea), means that all team members are aware of the current problems and solutions and can update their work accordingly. The tweeks made during this time make sure that all work is as accurate as possible.

Depending on how your team does things, you may stop at the prototype creation stage and perform user testing that feeds back into the team and further changes can be made. Whether you do this in between sprints is up to you, but i’d suggest you do, otherwise the team may be twiddling their thumbs waiting for their work to continue.

This length of time the whole process takes depends on how complex the work is and should be planned accordingly, with the whole team involved, naturally!
