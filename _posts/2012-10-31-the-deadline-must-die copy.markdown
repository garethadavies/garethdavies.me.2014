After 10 years designing and developing web sites and web application for a wide variety of clients, I have come to the conclusion that the deadline must die.

Now, i don't actually mean all deadlines should go the way of the monty python parrot, even if I wish they would. Going deadline-less does not suit the majority of situations and when you know for certain that a project definitely has to be done by a certain date, then a deadline is unavoidable.

What i hope to express in this post, is that in most situations, the presence of a ill conceived deadline will result in nothing but bringing negativity to a project and causing consternation to all involved. So, i see the solution to this being not to set one at all.

### The reality of deadlines

In many situations, the deadline for a project is set by someone who has little idea how long the work involved in completing the project will actually take. As most designers and developers know, predicting the length of time needed to make a product ready to ship, is a pretty vague guess at best. You can never compensate for a bug that takes 3 days to fix, a lack of inspiration when creating the visual design or user feedback that suggests major changes may be required. So, starting off any project by setting a stern deadline tends to put the development team immediately on the back-foot.

### When things go wrong

Ask yourself how many projects have you worked on that have come in on time, on budget and all parties involved have been delighted with the result? Be honest. If you can say most, then congratulations and you may leave class early and play outside on the grass. But i suspect the majority of projects either miss their deadline or deliver a sub standard product due to time restrictions.

When this has happened to projects i have been involved in, it normally results in one or all of the following outcomes:

1. The quality of work is below par
2. Team moral is diminished
3. The loss of valuable staff
4. Divisions have appeared within parties involved 
5. The company/organisation's reputation has be tarnished
6. Value-adding product features have been removed to meet the deadline
7. The outcome of the project satisfied no ones expectations, meaning all-round disappointment and a lack of willingness to develop the project further

So how do we avoid these outcomes when a deadline is unavoidable?

### The unavoidable deadline

Let us for a minute deal with an unavoidable deadline as this, i have no doubt, is the situation most of you will find yourself in. Firstly as yourself these questions:

1. Who is setting the deadline?
2. Is the work required actually achievable before the deadline?
3. Is there room for compromise on scope?
4. Can extra hours/overtime be worked and be welcomed by the development team?
5. What can the team do to improve productivity? New computers? Better software?

With answers for all these questions, you can at least go about trying to save the project at the beginning of the process, not the end. But how do we do this?

### Reviving a deadline

A well thought out and realistic deadline can offer focus to a development team and a certain amount of pressure levied can often yield positive results, but for this to happen, there needs to be developer team involvement in the project from the very outset.

Following these guidelines and keeping the questions set out above in mind will ensure that if a deadline is set, it is a fair and achievable one:

1. Make sure that the deadline is set based on feedback from the development team
2. Set out realistic deliverables if a strict deadline is set
3. Ensure that your client/boss knows exactly what the development team will deliver
4. Be realistic about estimating timescales for planned work and allow for contingencies
5. Offer incentives to the development team to complete work above and beyond their remit 
6. Involve ALL of the project team in planning the project

Hopefully, with the full involvement of the development team in planning the project and setting a valid deadline, the project will avoid the common negative outcomes mentioned previously.

### Working deadline-less

Now we have covered the realities of deadlines and discussed some of the pitfalls and solutions to possible negative outcomes, It is time to discuss a much easier solution than anything set out previously, and that is to work deadline-less.

It is all well and good for me to write about not setting deadlines, but I also know that doing so without the correct preparation is a foolhardy venture. So i'll put my money where my mouth is with the following advice.

Consider the following as essential prerequisites to working deadline-less:

#### 1. Minimum Specification

You should define a minimum specification for the launch of the project and work until it is achieved. The product is ready when it is ready.

#### 2. Be Iterative

Make sure you follow up the first release with regular iterations that introduce improvements based on user testing.

#### 3. Get the right team

Deadline-less work is only successful if your team loves and is enthusiastic about their work and is dedicated to producing the best product they can.

#### 4. Trust

All of this is only possible if you have the trust of your client or boss and they believe in the work you are doing. You do this by being forthright with your views, honest in your estimations and by delivering what you promise.

#### 5. Building Relationships

A deadline-less work process works best when a continuing relationship with the client is already planned. A 'get the work done and get them out' attitude will not allow trust to develop and they will probably go elsewhere from then on.

### Results

If you are lucky enough to be in a position to remove the burden of a deadline from your project work, i believe you will reap these rewards:

1. A product that is ready for launch
2. A product that is in a state all are aware of and happy with
3. A happier development team
4. Continued enthusiasm for the project
5. Future work is already lined up

Give it a try.
